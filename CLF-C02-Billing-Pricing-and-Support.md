### Introduction

Making sense of the price tags
- You've probably heard of the cloud in the past few years, referring to ambiguous things that no one quite seems to define. You might have also heard of Amazon Web Services. Perhaps your company is considering utilizing it, or you're looking to find out more about this cloud computing platform that's taking the world by storm for your own career advancement. Whatever the reason may be that got you to click on this course, I'm glad you're here. I want to help you start from what even is the cloud to getting excited about Amazon Web Services, cloud computing, and potentially even consider taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. Hi, I'm Hiro Nishimura, and I'm a special education teacher turned systems administrator turned technical writer and my mission is to introduce cloud computing and Amazon Web Service to people with non-traditional technical backgrounds. In Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers for Billing and Pricing, we will be learning about the ins and outs of how Amazon Web Services bills for resource use and how it prices services and support plans. This course is also a vital part of your exam prep if you're thinking about taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. I can't wait to begin our cloud journey. Let's get started.

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam
- The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is the only foundational level AWS certification exam available from Amazon Web Services. It serves to validate a candidate's foundational knowledge of the AWS Cloud. In September 2023, the exam was updated from exam code CLF-C01 to CLF-C02. With the exam code change, came some substantial updates that we will go over in this four-part course series. The AWS CLF-CO2 is a multiple choice or multiple response question exam that is pass or fail. The exam is catered towards cloud beginners and those who don't necessarily have a background in IT. It covers AWS concepts, security and compliance, core AWS services, and economics of the AWS cloud. There is no prior experience in the AWS cloud required for someone to prepare for and sit for this exam. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is divided into four domains, cloud concepts, which makes up 24% of the exam, security and compliance, which makes up 30% of the exam, cloud technology and services, which makes up 34% of the exam, and billing, pricing, and support, which makes up 12% of the exam. Each of the four courses in this series maps to a specific domain in the exam. Let's dig deeper into the specific domain this course maps to.

Billing, Pricing, and Support domain
- In the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, there are four domains. They are cloud concepts, security and compliance, cloud technology and services, and billing, pricing, and support. The four introductory AWS courses I teach on LinkedIn Learning follow each of these four domains. This fourth course mainly covers the billing, pricing, and support domain of the certification exam, which makes up 12% of the exam. For this portion of the exam, AWS wants you to compare AWS pricing models, understand resources for billing, budget, and cost management, and identify AWS technical resources and support options. We will dive into concepts like how AWS usage is charged, resources for budgeting and cost management, the different AWS support plans available, and where you can find AWS resources for questions or support. Even though the billing, pricing, and support domain is the smallest section by far on the exam, the questions pertaining to this domain can be fairly nitty gritty, so we want to make sure you're well prepared. Let's get started.

### Billing and Pricing

AWS Billing dashboard
- You've decided to host your static website on AWS, register the domain through Route 53, AWS's domain name system, and hosted your website on Amazon S3, a storage service. You've now got bills to pay for your AWS resource use. What do you do? You log into your AWS admin console and check out the AWS billing dashboard. The AWS billing dashboard allows you to estimate and plan your AWS costs, simplify your accounting if you have multiple AWS accounts through a feature called consolidated billing, and receive alerts for your service usage thresholds, which could help keep you from spending more money than you anticipated. Even when you haven't begun incurring usage costs yet, you can still check out the billing dashboard to learn how you can visualize your monthly chargeable costs and bills. Invoices are generated after monthly billing period, or when subscriptions or one-time purchases are made.

Types of charges
- One of the biggest benefits utilizing cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services for your IT infrastructure instead of the legacy on-premises IT infrastructure is the ability to benefit from the pay as you go pricing model instead of the pay full price before you receive model. Instead of purchasing an expensive server outright, you could quickly spin up a virtual server on AWS and pay only for monthly usage fees for the resources you consumed. Once you're done using it, you can stop paying the monthly fees. Awesome, right, well, it's definitely awesome, but there are actually a few granularities in how AWS's pricing structures work before you go around spinning up every service in AWS. So let's take a look. Different service types may be built differently. Some like Amazon Simple Storage Service or Amazon S3 is a storage service. Think box.com or Dropbox, and we charge for per gigabyte of usage. For compute services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or Amazon EC2, you may be charged per hour of use. There are three fundamental ways you will be charged for AWS resource use: Compute, storage and outbound data transfer. Inbound data transfer or moving data into AWS is generally free. However, one caveat is that there is outbound and inbound data transfer within AWS two and the pricing could change depending on which region the data originates from and which region it ends up in. If you're considering moving your resources from one AWS region to another, such as from US East one to US East two, it would be best to consult with official AWS knowledge-based documentation before implementing to prevent surprise bills. Incoming data transfer costs are generally free across all services in all regions, but outgoing costs may vary from region to region as well as cross availability zones. A great place to check out how different services charge for usage on AWS is the AWS pricing page on their official website, which you can access through aws.amazon.com/pricing. There's also a great white paper from AWS documentation titled How AWS Pricing Works, AWS White Paper. That may be useful for your research. AWS also has several pricing models for purchasing computing resources that incentivizes planning ahead, as well as consuming more resources. You could imagine the pricing structure as buying in bulk at wholesale store prices versus buying the same thing, but in smaller quantities at your local grocery store. Pay as you go or on demand instances is the most flexible pricing plan where you only pay for what you use with no need for commitment and flexibility to changes in needs. Save when you commit or reserved instances allows you to save money by committing to using a specific resource for a certain period of time. You can think of it like your gym membership being a little prier month to month, but cheaper per month if you commit to a one year plan. If you're using AWS organization's function with consolidated billing, which helps you have all of your organization's AWS accounts under one billing account, all of the accounts are treated as one single account when it comes to receiving the hourly cost benefits of reserve instances that are purchased by any other account in that organization. Save when you commit type two or saving plans. Like reserved instances, you can save money by committing in advance with saving plans. The very high level difference is that you commit to an hourly spend or how much you spend per an hour of usage as opposed to resource usage or booking a certain amount of computing power. You can save up to 72% compared to on-demand pricing for one or three year hourly spend commitment. Take advantages of unutilized AWS capacity with spot instances is next. AWS has loads and loads of servers at the ready to service its global customers. As a result, a lot of the resources go unused from time to time. To solve this problem, AWS will put these unutilized resources up for sale with huge savings compared with on demand instances. Amazon EC2 spot instances are up to 90% off on demand pricing. The downside to relying on spot instances is that they're not always available, so you would only be able to utilize them for resources you need for short periods of time on a flexible schedule. Spot instances are great for running tests or doing computational work with flexible timing. You can save by using your own licenses and utilize dedicated hardware with dedicated hosts. Your organization may have already purchased software licenses from vendors for a discount and may want to use them on your virtual machines running on AWS. With Amazon EC2 dedicated hosts, you can benefit from the cost effectiveness of utilizing your own licenses while also taking advantage of that elasticity and simplicity of AWS. With dedicated hosts, as the name suggests, you get your own physical server dedicated to your organization, which can help with certain compliance requirements. Run Amazon EC2 instances on dedicated hardware or dedicated instances. Amazon EC2 instances are, by default, running on shared tenancy hardware, which means that while each instance is isolated, it's still running on the same server that's shared between many different customers. Dedicated instances provide each customer with a dedicated hardware so that instances are isolated from other customers at a hardware level. Each physical hardware is linked to one single AWS account, though this specific hardware may have non-dedicated instance from that same AWS account. As with dedicated hosts, utilizing dedicated instances may help solve some compliance requirements for your organization. You can also reserve compute capacity in advance with capacity reservations. Sometimes your workloads are flexible and can be turned on or off depending on resource availability, but other times, you want to make sure the resource is available in advance in a certain availability zone. While there is no explicit savings from reserving in advance with capacity reservation compared to on demand rate, you are not charged anything for the reservation, allowing you to be confident that you have resources available to you when you need it without any additional costs. The difference between if you save when you commit instances explained above and a capacity reservation is that you begin to be charged only when the capacity reservations begin utilizing the resources and not beforehand. So you're committing but not paying in advance. The concept of pay less per unit or volume by using more allows you to take advantage of volume discounts for certain services, such as receiving tiered pricing for Amazon S3, where the more you use, the less you pay per gigabyte of storage.

AWS Free Tier
- Are you excited to try out AWS Cloud and play with the services, but a little nervous about the potential cost associated with using it? Fear not, the AWS Free Tier is here for you. The AWS Free Tier allows potential customers to test out and become comfortable with many services offered by AWS Cloud for free. Most of the offers expire after 12 months, at which point you'll be charged for the services you consume at regular rates. As you near the expiration date of the Free Tier, you'll get a notification from AWS. You're then responsible for manually turning down or deleting the services for which you don't want to be charged. You can find the Free Tier offerings by going to aws.amazon.com/free. Here, you'll notice that AWS has over 60 services available for use, separated into three different types of offers. The three types of offers in AWS Free Tier are: Always free. 12 months free. And Trials. First option is Always free, which, as you might guess, shows services that are always free to use up to a certain point. There are generally usage limits after which point you must pay to use these services. The second option is 12 months free. These services are free for use, also generally up to a certain usage limit, for 12 months after your initial signup date. Some of the common usage limitations are use time, number of requests, amount of storage, number of characters, and number of actions per month. Once you go above a usage limit, you'll be charged for the service you use, even if you're still within the first 12 months. The final type of Free Tier offerings are Trials. Most of the trials for for less than 12 months and have stricter usage limits. The common limitations are use time, use of space, or number of requests. The AWS Free Tier is a great opportunity to test out and learn about many of the core services that power the AWS Cloud, and I highly recommend that you go take advantage of the different offers.

Study break: Billing and pricing
- Let's take a few minutes to quickly review what we learned in this section. First off, the AWS billing dashboard is the go-to place to plan your AWS spending, simplify your accounting through consolidated billing, and receive alerts for service usage thresholds. Cost Explorer lets you get granular information about your AWS usage and generate billing reports with a breakdown of costs and usage. The AWS billing dashboard is an important part of making sure your AWS bills are expected and paid. Next off, let's discuss different types of AWS charges and ways to purchase computing resources. The pay-as-you-go model of cloud computing includes the different ways AWS charges you for your AWS cloud resource usage. The three fundamental ways you can be charged are compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. Different services have different ways of charging and pricing, and in general, the more you do something, like compute, store, or transfer data, the cheaper per unit the action becomes. AWS rewards you for planning ahead, which can be seen in the different compute resource pricing models available. Some of these plans are reserved instances, savings plans, spot instances, dedicated hosts, dedicated instances, and capacity reservations. Finally, we learned about and explored the AWS free tier. The AWS Free tier is a great opportunity to test out and learn about many of the core services that power the AWS cloud and has three types of offers. Free trials, which are short-term free trial offers for specific services. Twelve months free, which provides 12 months offers for service usage once you sign up for your AWS account. And always free, which provides a certain amount, or level of resource use for free for as long as you have an AWS account. Do you need a refresher for any of these concepts? Feel free to pause and go back to the videos from this section before moving on to the next section.

### Billing, Budget and Cost Management

AWS budget and cost management resources
- AWS's billing and pricing can get fairly complicated pretty quickly. There's always a tweet or two on my timeline bemoaning a forgotten virtual server that racked up unexpected fees or a surprise $10,000 bill. There are also countless third party billing, cost analysis, and budgeting softwares and services available for organizations to take advantage of to keep their spending in check and to make sure their resource usage is aligned with their spending goals. AWS also has their own services and resources to help tackle the AWS billing and pricing issues, and they have been updating and consolidating different resources to make them more robust and easier to use. Some core resources we will discuss are AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Cost and Usage Report, or AWS CUR, AWS Billing Conductor, and the AWS Pricing Calculator. As the name suggests, AWS Budgets allow you to set up custom budgets to track your AWS resource costs and usage, and send you alerts when you exceed your threshold so you don't have surprise bills at the end of the month. Depending on the alert and your needs, you can then respond with custom actions to prevent outages, inefficient resource use, or lack of coverage before a surprise. You can also have AWS send you an AWS Budgets report daily, weekly, or monthly via email to help you monitor the performance of your budget portfolio. AWS Budgets helps you visualize costs before you spend. AWS Cost Explorer helps you analyze after you spend. As with personal finances, you have to have both budget and keep track of your monthly spending to get an accurate view of your financial situation. AWS Cost Explorer helps you visualize, understand, and manage AWS costs over time with an easy to use interface that lets you create custom reports based on your usage to analyze data at high or granular levels. It also creates a cost and usage forecast for projecting future AWS costs. What could AWS Cost and Usage Report or AWS CUR possibly do? If you guessed providing your AWS cost and usage data as a report, you'd be right. AWS Cost and Usage Report helps organizations understand the cost drivers in their AWS infrastructure and identify ways to optimize their monthly AWS usage bills. They do this by providing metadata, or data about data, on the following components: AWS services, pricing, credits, fees, taxes, discounts, cost categories, Reserved Instances, and savings plans. One way to make the AWS Cost and Usage Report useful to your particular organization is to utilize the AWS cost allocation tags where you can utilize AWS generated tags and user defined tags to get reports customized to meet your needs. In the most basic sense, tags are labels that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource consisting of a key and a value. Armed with this metadata, you can integrate the information with Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon QuickSight to analyze this cost and usage information further. When you need to conduct the orchestra that is your organization's resource usage cost or customer's IT cost management, you'll want to utilize AWS Billing Conductor. Whereas the previous services helped you budget or analyze your spending, AWS Billing Conductor helps you analyze your organization or your customer's spending, and then utilize that information to build them for resource usage based on your defined rates. This tool allows you and your customers or stakeholders to see what is being utilized every month, and then use that information to bill for usage with customized reports. You can also generate AWS Cost and Usage Reports for each of your billing groups, like your organizations and clients. You can learn more about the above resources and many more by going to aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management where Cloud Financial Management resources are collected and introduced. The AWS Pricing Calculator is located conveniently at calculator.aws and has more or less replaced what used to be known as the AWS Total Cost of Ownership Calculator. This calculator takes your estimated resource usage inputs from your current IT infrastructure setup and calculates estimated costs for running your workloads on AWS Cloud. This allows you to consider whether or not moving to the AWS Cloud could mean cost savings for your organization. While the previous resources are for after your Cloud implementation, this service is meant to be utilized while still considering whether to move your infrastructure to AWS Cloud or other cloud computing platforms to create a cost benefit analysis for the potential migration.

Consolidated billing
- When a company embraces the cloud and all of the infrastructure engineering teams happily pounce on to AWS and begin building, a single company may end up with multiple AWS accounts. Maybe the development team wants to split up their production and test environments, so there won't be any accidental deployments. Or maybe the marketing team wants their own instance for the company website. Other times, it just might make sense for different projects to open different accounts to keep their billing responsibilities apparent. Whatever the reason may be, having multiple AWS accounts is likely a huge headache for the accounting team when they need to keep track of all the accounts and numbers. To make their lives easier, AWS introduces the consolidated billing option. As the name suggests, it allows an organization to create a payer account that views and pays combined billing charges for all linked accounts. It is strictly an accounting and billing account and can't use any other services. However, it's still an independent account. The account cannot deploy services into the linked accounts. Using consolidated billing comes with a great perk of all of the resource usage being considered part of one large organization. So even though they may be in separate accounts, the organization may be eligible for volume discounts for the combined usage. For busy organizations with many separate AWS accounts, consolidated billing is a must use for the accounting department to easily review and pay bills, as well as take advantage of potential volume pricing discounts. Best of all, it's free.

### Support and Billing Resources

AWS Support Plans: Part 1
- Where there's a service, there's a need for support. AWS has five tiers of support plans available, depending on your organization's needs and budget. Depending on the level of technical support, and how much proactive architectural support you want, the price points for these support plans can range from $0 a month to starting from $15,000 a month. These support plans are Basic support plan, Developer support plan, Business support plan, Enterprise On-Ramp support plan, and Enterprise support plan. It's very important to note that these support plan costs are an addition to your AWS resource usage costs. So if you're paying for Enterprise support plan, and have $150,000 in monthly AWS charges, you'll be paying $15,000 in support plan costs on top of that. Proceed with caution. Let's start out with a Basic support plan, which is free and is automatically applied when you open your AWS account. As it's a default and basic support plan option, its functionalities are fairly limited. Your support requests are limited to account and billing questions as well as service quota increase requests. You also have access to white papers, documentations, best-practice guides and support communities, such as AWS Repost, as well as the AWS Health Dashboard. You're also eligible to utilize the free service health checks from AWS Trusted Advisor. This support plan works very well with the AWS Free Tier we learned about in the first section of this course. This support plan may be for you if you're a developer or a newbie looking to test out different services and resources, or looking for hands-on experience with the AWS user interface and core services. This plan may also be for you if your organization is considering moving your IT infrastructures to cloud, and is in the process of evaluating different cloud platforms, including AWS. This plan is great for people testing out AWS and its services, but have no production workloads on AWS Cloud. When you run into technical issues with the Basic support plan, the best you can do is post on forums like AWS Repost, and cross your fingers for a nuanced response to come your way. But when you begin requiring a bit more tangible technical support from AWS, but still aren't ready to commit to the higher support plan prices, the Developer support plan may be the best option for you. The Developer support plan is a great choice for developers and IT departments still in the experimental phases of building up their IT infrastructure on AWS. The plan offers more customized support, including the ability to open support tickets, but it's still not ideal for production workloads. If something goes wrong and you have production workloads hosted on AWS, the support services offered by this plan may not be enough or fast enough to help you resolve the issue in a timely manner. The Developer support plan charges a monthly fee that is the greater of $20 a month or 3% of your monthly AWS charges. In addition to everything you have access to in the Basic support plan, you also receive best-practice guidance, access to client-side diagnostic tools, and prioritized support responses on AWS Repost. You also receive access to AWS Support App in Slack. You can now open an unlimited number of support cases via one primary contact, which is your account's root user, with business-hour email access to Cloud Support Associates. The support response times are less than 24 hours for general guidance and less than 12 hours for impaired systems. You can receive Building Block architecture support, which guides you on how to utilize different AWS products, features, and services together effectively. Finally, AWS offers self-service automations created by the AWS support team to help you manage your AWS resources without having to resort to opening tickets. With the Developer support plan, you have access to Support Automation Workflows, or SAW runbooks with the prefix AWSSupport. Runbooks help you proactively monitor and identify network issues, collect and analyze logs, and troubleshoot common issues with AWS resources.

AWS Support Plans: Part 2
- When you've moved on from testing experimenting phase to production phase, the Business Support Plan is AWS's minimum recommended tier of support generally. Production workloads, or resources, or services your customers can use or see, like applications or websites. In addition to the resources and services provided by the Developer Support Plan, the Business Support Plan comes with faster response times for tickets, and more robust services and features. The pricing model becomes a little more complicated. The monthly fee is greater of $100 a month, or 10% of monthly charges for the first zero to $10,000 of AWS resource use, then 7% of monthly charges from $10,000 to $80,000, then 5% of monthly charges from $80,000 to $250,000, and 3% of monthly charges over $250,000. Yeah, a little complicated to say the least. The important thing to keep in mind is that it'll never be below $100 and goes up with the use of AWS resources. And let's keep in mind that this support plan cost is on top of your AWS resource usage cost. Enrolling in the Business Support Plan provides access to the full set of checks with the AWS Trusted Advisors best practice checks instead of just the basic checks that were offered with the Basic and Developer Support Plan. You also have access to the AWS Support API to automate support case management with AWS Trusted Advisor and Support Center. You also receive access to use-case guidance to help you see what AWS products and services you should utilize to support your organization's specific needs, as well as access to Support Automation Workflows with prefix AWSPremiumSupport in addition to AWSSupport. For an additional fee, you can also receive Infrastructure Event Management. For support response times, the Business Support Plan provides less than 24 hours for general guidance, less than 12 hours for system impaired, less than four hours for production system impaired, and less than one hour for production system down. You also have 24/7 phone, email, and chat access to AWS Cloud Support engineers. As you may have intuited, there's a lot more nuances and levels of impairment in the speed of support than with the Developer Support Plan. When things go kaput, you need support fast. However, even this may not be quick enough depending on how many users you support and how mission-critical your resources are. Once you're paying thousands of dollars every month for the Business Support Plan, it may be time to consider moving up to the Enterprise On-Ramp Support Plan. The Enterprise On-Ramp Support Plan is a new Support Plan tier that was added to the Support Plan roster in 2021. For a minimum spend of $5,500 a month or 10% of your monthly AWS charges, whichever is greater, you can receive customized premium support for much less than the minimum spend of $15,000 a month required for Enterprise Support Plans. The Enterprise On-Ramp Support Plan is for organizations with business-critical workloads hosted on the AWS Cloud, and comes with more customized support than the previous Support Plans. On top of everything you have access to with the Business Support Plan, you have access to consultative application architecture guidance on how different AWS services and resources can fit together to meet your organization's specific use case. You can also benefit from an annual short-term engagement with AWS Support for architectural and scaling guidance for Infrastructure Event Management. This service was available for a fee with the Business Support Plan. Your support cases proactive guidance and general use case support comes from a pool of Technical Account Managers or TAMs, which is like having your very own white-gloved team of cloud concierge. You also receive white-gloved case routing via the Concierge Support team. Talk about good service. As for the support response times, general guidance system impaired and production system impaired support times are the same as the Business Support Plan. But there's a new case severity, which is business critical system down, which has a support time of less than 30 minutes. Now, we're finally up to the, drum roll, please, the big and mighty Enterprise Support Plan. The Enterprise Support Plan is recommended for organizations with business and or mission-critical workloads hosted on AWS, especially those with huge monthly resource spends. The minimum monthly spend is higher of $15,000 or 10% of monthly charges for the first zero to $150,000, 7% of monthly charges from $150,000 to $500,000, 4% of monthly charges from $500,000 to $1 million, and 3% of monthly charges over $1 million. This support plan is for heavy users needing heavy-handed and comprehensive support from AWS. In addition to the perks and white-glove services provided for the Enterprise On-Ramp Support Plan, you also receive Infrastructure Event Management that's not limited to once per year. And access to proactive workshops, reviews, and deep dives for your organization. For an additional fee, your organization can receive AWS Incident Detection and Response service. Instead of a group of TAMs, you will be assigned a TAM to proactively monitor and assist with optimizing your AWS Cloud environment, coordinate access to AWS experts, as well as relevant programs for your organization and employees. Your TAM can also provide you with AWS Trusted Advisor Priority for prioritized recommendations curated by the AWS account team. On top of programs, your organization also receives access to online self-paced labs for employee training. Your case response times are the same with Enterprise On-Ramp Support Plan for general guidance, system impaired, production system impaired, and production system down. But for business and or mission critical systems down, it is less than 15 minutes. These videos on the AWS Support plans, though filled with a lot of information, don't provide an exhaustive list of services and resources each support plan provides, as they're modified and expanded on regularly. To compare and contrast the AWS Support plans in more detail, you can take a look at AWS's official page titled, "Compare AWS support plans," available at aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans.

Finding AWS resources
- Before you contact support, hire an expensive AWS consultant, or sign up for a hefty AWS support plan you would probably check out some AWS resources and documentation available for free to help troubleshoot your issues or to learn more about certain services. Thankfully, there are tons and tons of official documentation and resources available, and the quality is getting better in the past few years. You can find ready access AWS resources at AWS White Papers, Blogs, and Documentation. You can ask questions and get responses from peers, AWS community leaders, and AWS employees at AWS re:Post. AWS Knowledge Center is an official AWS re:Post hub that answers most frequently asked questions and requests they receive from AWS customers in articles and videos formats. If you are looking for business or technological solutions and don't want to architect infrastructure from the ground up, you could take advantage of the AWS Marketplace where vendors and partners provide expert services and software solutions that run on AWS for you to purchase and utilize. If a company is creating an AWS-based business, they could gain credibility in AWS-supported programs to help expand and differentiate their offerings by joining the AWS Partner Program. Aside from the credibility you earn by being an official AWS-sanctioned partner, your organization can receive partner training, certification, volume discounts, and attend partner events. The AWS Partner Network has a group of highly-skilled partners that provide AWS professional services to help you as a customer execute your enterprise cloud computing initiatives. Some programs available to AWS Partners, may be the AWS Marketplace Channel programs, where partners can sell their AWS products, like pre-made Amazon EC2 instance templates on the AWS Marketplace; and AWS Training Partner Program, which validates authenticity of a training program by becoming an official AWS training partner. As a consumer, when you encounter issues, you could look to companies that are part of the AWS Partner Programs to find qualified service providers to solve your business needs. When you're ready to talk to someone, you also have access to the AWS support plans that we just learned about in this section, with tiered services available, depending on how much you utilize your AWS resources and how much you're willing to pay. When you encounter abuse of AWS resources, you can contact the AWS Trust and Safety Team through a form available when you Google report abusive activity from Amazon Web Service resources. Sometimes you might just be thinking, please just let me contact AWS support directly. For that, AWS has a page dedicated for AWS Support Services available both to the public and for subscribers at AWS.amazon.com/contact-us.

Study break: Reviewing support and billing resources
- We again went through quite a lot of information in this section. Let's take a few minutes to review. We learned about the AWS support plans, which provide different levels of support and resources for different price points. Most of the plans have monthly pricing plans that correlates with your organization's monthly AWS usage. The support plans are basic support plan, developer support plan, business support plan, enterprise on-ramp support plan, and enterprise support plan. It's important to understand the differences, especially in the cost as the monthly fees are on top of your monthly AWS resource usage feeds. It ranges from $0 a month to starting at $15,000 a month. We also learned about where you could find AWS support resources and information before directly contacting support services like AWS Whitepapers, blogs, and documentation, and AWS re:Post. When you're ready to get some personalized support, we learn about who you can contact, like the AWS Partner Network, AWS Support Center, and the AWS Trust and Safety Team. If you aren't quite sure about any of these topics we discussed, feel free to take a few minutes to go back to the videos in this section before moving on. See you again soon.

### Conclusion

Exam tips and resources
- The billing, pricing, and support domain of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam or CLF-CO2 makes up 12% of the exam, which is down from 16% from the CLF-CO1. Despite the percentage being lowered, it is still very important information to learn and retain, especially if you will be utilizing the AWS Cloud for your work in the future. No one likes a surprise bill at the end of the month. There are three task statements in this domain, which are: compare AWS pricing models; understand resources for billing, budget and cost management; and identify AWS technical resources and AWS support options. We began this course by learning about the AWS Billing Dashboard, which is your billing HQ, helping you visualize and plan your AWS spending and simplify your accounting. We also learned about different types of charges like compute storage and data transfers, and also about the different compute purchasing options, like on demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances. We wrapped up the first section by introducing the AWS Free tier, which is a great place to start when beginning your hands-on AWS experience. In the next section, we learned about consolidated billing and many different AWS budget and cost management resources to help simplify, visualize, analyze, and plan your AWS spending. And in the last section of this course, we learned about the robust AWS support plans, which range in monthly costs from $0 a month to starting at $15,000 a month on top of your AWS resource usage. And we also learned about where you can find AWS technical, billing, and other support. Oh, an extra tip. Are you thinking, well, which AWS support plan is more expensive, the business support plan, or the developer support plan? A silly little saying that I came up with to memorize the five support plans in order of the monthly cost was Ba De Bu Eo En. Ba for basic, De for developer, Bu for Business, E-O for Enterprise On-Ramp, and another E-N for Enterprise. The monthly prices and features provided go up in that order. Yeah, I know you're thinking that's really, really silly, but bear with me here. Something this silly has actually helped a lot of my students remember the order, and who knows if you repeat it enough, it might even come to haunt, I mean, help you on your exam too. Well, this was one of the shorter courses in this course series, it was still jam packed with information and resources. If any of these topics seem worthy of a quick refresher, please feel free to go back and re-watch the videos. If you've been watching all four courses in this series that helped you prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, I wish you the best of luck and sitting for it. See you on the flip side.
