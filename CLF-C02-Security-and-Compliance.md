## Introduction

## Security in the cloud

- You've probably heard of the cloud in the past few years referring to ambiguous things that no one quite seems to define. You might have also heard of Amazon Web Services. Perhaps your company is considering utilizing it, or you're looking to find out more about this cloud computing platform that's taking the world by storm for your own career advancement. Whatever the reason may be that got you to click on this course, I'm glad you're here. I want to help you start from what even is the cloud to getting excited about Amazon Web Services, cloud computing, and potentially even consider taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. Hi, I'm Hiro Nishimura, and I'm a special education teacher turned systems administrator, turned technical writer, and my mission is to introduce cloud computing and Amazon Web services to people with non-traditional technical backgrounds. In Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers 2: Security, we will be focusing on security in the cloud and how it is similar and different from security in legacy IT infrastructure. We'll learn about security-related services offered through Amazon Web Services and various security-related concepts that are important to keep in mind as you consider moving your resources onto the cloud. This course is also a vital part of your exam prep if you are thinking about taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. I can't wait to begin our cloud journey. Let's get started.

## AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam

- The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is the only foundational level AWS certification exam available from Amazon Web Services. It serves to validate a candidate's foundational knowledge of the AWS Cloud. In September 2023, the exam was updated from exam code CLF-C01 to CLF-C02. With the exam code change came some substantial updates that we will go over in this four part course series. The AWS CLF-CO2 is a multiple choice or multiple response question exam that is passed or fail. The exam is catered towards cloud beginners and those who don't necessarily have a background in IT. It covers AWS concepts, security and compliance, core AWS services, and economics of the AWS Cloud. There is no prior experience in the AWS Cloud required for someone to prepare for and sit for this exam. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is divided into four domains, cloud concepts, which makes up 24% of the exam, security and compliance, which makes up 30% of the exam, cloud technology and services, which makes up 34% of the exam, and billing, pricing and support, which makes up 12% of the exam. Each of the four courses in this series maps to a specific domain in the exam. Let's dig deeper into the specific domain this course maps to.

## Security and Compliance domain

- In the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam, there are four domains. They are Cloud concepts, Security and Compliance, Cloud Technology and Services, and Billing, Pricing, and Support. The four introductory AWS courses I teach on LinkedIn Learning follow each of these four domains. This course mainly covers the Security and Compliance domain, which makes up 30% of the exam. Because securing the cloud by keeping your AWS Cloud infrastructure safe from both internal and external exploits is extremely important. The Security domain is well worth your time to investigate. To do well in this domain, you need to understand the AWS shared responsibility model, understand AWS cloud security, governance, and compliance concepts, identify AWS access management capabilities, and identify components and resources for security. We will review different security-related concepts like the shared responsibility model, security pillar of the Well-Architected Framework, and what the core AWS security services are. We will talk about what it means to secure the cloud, which could be a little different or similar to securing your own on-premises IT infrastructure in a data center. In addition, we will review some major security-related AWS services, like AWS Identity Access Management, AWS Web Application Firewall, and AWS Trusted Advisor amongst other core security services. We'll provide study breaks and exam study tips so you can begin preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam Security and Compliance Domain. Ready to get started? Let's go.

## Security in the cloud

- Security in the Cloud. If you're anything like me, when you think about security for your data and your IT infrastructure, you probably think of the server room in your office locked with a card key that only the IT department has. Or maybe your company has a data center offsite that you have to drive two hours to get to to make sure your backups are being saved securely. When you get to the data center, you probably encounter a lot of security personnel and need to submit a lot of credentials to step into the facility and get anywhere near the servers. This image of securing data is quickly being replaced by cloud-based security, where you no longer have to keep costly data centers functioning and secured. Instead, you can have a cloud computing service provider manage their own data centers on your behalf so you can focus on other aspects of IT infrastructure management. When you deploy your IT resources into AWS Cloud, you benefit from the global network of data centers and architecture built with security in mind. AWS helps you keep your data safe in their highly secure data centers, and there are safeguards in place to help protect customer privacy. There are dozens of compliance programs embedded into AWS to help you meet your industry's compliance requirements for data security. Securing your data on AWS Cloud allows you to maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own data centers, which saves you time and money. It also allows you to scale the size of your business quickly, as AWS is designed to keep data safe no matter how big or small your cloud usage is. Let's learn about a few concepts and frameworks for security in the cloud before discussing specific security-related services that AWS offers.

## Shared responsibility model

- When utilizing the cloud to house any part of your technical infrastructure, you must first consider the security impacts of moving your resources onto the cloud, unlike the on-premises data center that is protected by the virtue of being within your physical reach, data centers hosting your cloud resources on an undisclosed location and data centers managed by AWS. So who's responsible for the security of the data center, the servers, the networks, the data itself, all those EC2 instances that are running computations? Who makes sure their security patches are up to date? Who protects the data from being corrupted? AWS has a model that helps to puzzle these questions out called the Shared Responsibility Model. As you might expect from the name, the shared responsibility model asserts that the security of cloud computing infrastructures is a shared responsibility between the customer and AWS. While there are certain parts of the infrastructure that the customers no longer have to worry about, there are still components that are the customer's responsibilities to secure. In the most basic breakdown, AWS is responsible for security of the cloud while you, the customer, are responsible for security in the cloud. Let's see if we can deconstruct what AWS might mean by this. When AWS says that they are responsible for security of the cloud, they mean that AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered by AWS Cloud. This includes hardware, software, networking, and the data center facilities that run their cloud computing platform. You can think of it like AWS is responsible for security of the components that make up the AWS Cloud, like the data centers and physical servers. On the other hand, when AWS says that the customers are responsible for security in the cloud, they mean that the customers are responsible for varying levels of security functions depending on which services they are using. These could be in forms of protecting customer data, platform, application, and identity or access management, or operating systems of virtual machines, configuring firewalls and data encryption. You can think about it like we are responsible for the security of things inside the AWS Cloud, like data encryption and patching servers. There are many granular settings and concepts within the shared responsibility model for AWS Cloud, which you can read on their website. But the basic concept that you need to know for the exam when this model is brought up is this: AWS is responsible for security of the cloud while you, as the customer, are responsible for security in the cloud.

## Well-architected framework

- When you are considering architecting how your AWS cloud IT infrastructure will look, you will have to put in a lot of considerations on how to make sure that it is secure from outside and inside threats. AWS has developed a concept called the six pillars of a well-architected framework to help you build the most secure, fault-resilient, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible. The pillars are discussed in the first course of this series that go over cloud concepts. Since this course pertains to security, we will be doing a deeper dive into, you guessed it, the security pillar. Security in the cloud is composed of five areas. They are identity and access management, or IAM, detective controls, infrastructure protection, data protection, and incident response. To make sure user access is managed properly, you would want to implement the strong identity foundation. This would entail utilizing the principle of least privilege, which means that you only provide access to what people need to do their jobs and no more. You should enable traceability by monitoring alerts, audit actions, and changes to your environment in real time. Security should be applied on all layers instead of just on a single outer layer of your infrastructure. For a virtual server, this could mean you make sure your infrastructure is secured at the organizational, subnet, load balancer, virtual machine, and operating system layers. Security best practices should also be automated so that you can scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. If the security methods are automated, you can just replicate that for every new instance or resource you deploy instead of having to manually set them up. Data should be protected at REST and in transit, and security mechanisms should be adjusted depending on the sensitivity of the data. You should also keep people away from the data by eliminating the need for direct access or manual processing of data. In this way, human error and loss or modification of sensitive data can be prevented. Finally, when a security event occurs, you should be prepared to intervene, investigate, and deal with the event. And once the issue is resolved, update the incident management process to learn from the security event. Security is a very vital part of running and architecting a well-architected framework, and you can strive for stability by focusing on protecting the data and resources against security events. And when an event occurs, to learn from the event and update incident management procedures.

## AWS cloud security, governance, and compliance concepts

- When thinking about migrating, building, or operating your IT infrastructure in the cloud, understanding cloud security, governance, and compliant concepts is vital. AWS strives to architect the most secure global cloud infrastructure in the cloud with a set of over 300 cloud security tools. You as the customer can take advantage of all the work AWS has put into securing its data centers and cloud services, saving you a lot of time, money, and manpower that would've otherwise been spent in securing your own data centers from the ground up. An upcoming portions of this course, we will go over some AWS security resources, and services such as Amazon Inspector, AWS Shield, and Amazon Guard Duty. AWS has dozens of compliance programs in its infrastructure to serve clients from around the world, which means they've done some of the work for you, in terms of compliance requirements. Some of the compliance certifications and security standards, it supports our HIPPA, FedRAMP, GDPR and PCIDSS. You can find a global list of IT standards AWS complies with by Googling AWS compliance programs. Generating audit reports with traditional data centers take time and labor, which could already be outdated by the time they're published. By utilizing AWS, you can instead utilize embedded automated compliance validation tools like AWS Security Hub, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, or AWS Audit Manager. AWS Artifact is also a great tool that is available in the management console, which serves a self-service audit artifact retrieval to download AWS security and compliance documents. We'll go over many of these tools in the next section of this course. Governance is the process of creating and enforcing decisions within an organization, basically making sure rules are followed. Governance and compliance goes hand in hand, as you must make or follow industry or government standards and laws, and then confirm that these roles are being followed by auditing your IT resources.

## Access Management

## Providing access in AWS

- We learned in the previous section that securing your IT infrastructure in the cloud is a joint venture between you, the customer, and AWS, the cloud computing platform provider. This concept is called the shared responsibility model. In this section of the course, we'll learn about another very important security concept, which is the principle of least privilege. There will be a whole video going over it, but in a very quick summary, it's the concept that you only provide the least amount of access for an entity to do their job and nothing more, in order to keep your resources secure. Hence, the least privilege. AWS provides many tools and resources to help you manage access permissions to many different types of accounts. You can utilize services like Amazon Identity and Access Management, or IAM, or IAM Identity Center to provide and control access for different identities in and out of your AWS environment. While there are granular permissions you can set using AWS IAM that would make even the most organized of us dizzy, Joey can have access to this but not this, some of this, but not that, all of this, but just two in this batch, at the core of this service is your ability to utilize IAM policies to define who can access what. There are a lot of jargons floating around here, so let's take a moment to decode a few of them relating to identity and access management. First up, identities are the whos you're providing access to for your resources. They could be users, groups of users, or roles. They could be AWS services, your app users, or a whole group of people requiring the same permission access, like the accounting team, amongst others. When providing access, many are human identities, which are human users. People like administrators, developers, and your customers utilizing your applications. Human users who belong to your organization are called workforce identities. Another type of identity is a workload, which is a collection of resources and code that provides business value, like web applications. A workload may request read or write data access to AWS services, for example, such as an Amazon EC2 Instance. There are also federated identities, which you might be familiar with if you've ever signed into a social media account using another service's account. For example, you might have signed into a blogging platform using your Facebook or Google account, allowing you to utilize the service as a member without having to set up a completely new account with its own credentials. Federated identity allows you to link a person's identity and attributes across multiple separate identity and access management systems. You may have heard of single sign-on or SSO, which allows a user to utilize a single authentication ticket or token to sign into multiple systems and organizations. In the previous example, your Facebook account is used to sign into completely unrelated systems like a blogging platform or a newspaper site using SSO. AWS has its own SSO service, which used to be conveniently called AWS Single Sign-On. It is now called AWS IAM Identity Center, and it might be worth it to know that they're the same thing. AWS IAM Identity Center is a centralized control tower to create and manage workforce permissions and policies for all of your AWS accounts and applications within your AWS organizations, as well as other cloud applications. A great way to control who has access to what, whether it be real humans, or machines, or services, is by utilizing roles. An IAM role has specific permissions with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in your AWS environment. While it is similar to an IAM user, it's not associated with one specific person. Instead, an identity assumes a role, kind of like wearing a Batman costume. And let's just pretend all it takes to have Batman's superpowers is to wear a Batman costume. Sally could one day assume an IAM role made for an administrative assistant while the next day assume an IAM role made for sales engineer to have permissions to do completely different actions in the AWS environment. A policy defines what an identity or resource can or cannot do. Permissions in these policies define whether an action is allowed or denied. There are also ways to control traffic to and from your resources. Security groups help you control traffic that is allowed to reach and lead the various AWS resources they're associated with, such as an EC2 Instance and VPC. You can think of security groups like a bouncer standing at the door of a bar checking you off on an approved guest list for an exclusive party. This party also happens to limit who can leave from the bar as well. You can also control traffic with network access control lists or network ACLs. These deny specific inbound or incoming or outbound or outgoing traffic to your resources at the subnet level. A subnet is essentially a network within a network. The difference between when to use a security group versus when to use a network access control list will likely come up on the exam. So here's a quick overview to jot down. Security groups protect your resources at the instance level like an Amazon EC2 Instance. While network access control list protect your resources at the subnet level. Security groups are stateful, which means traffic allowed in is allowed out because it remembers what it allowed in. Network access control lists are stateless, which means that it doesn't remember anything. So inbound and outbound traffic needs to be defined separately. Security groups also don't have the ability to explicitly deny. So if you need to explicitly deny traffic, you need to do that with a network access control list. All inbound traffic is blocked by default, and outbound traffic is allowed by default with security groups. While all inbound and outbound traffic is allowed by default with a network access control list. If you're interested in learning more about the different use cases of security groups versus network ACLs, you can check out AWS's knowledge base documentations.

## Identity access management (IAM)

- When utilizing the cloud to house any part of your technical infrastructure, you must first consider the security impacts of moving your resources onto the cloud. Unlike the on-premises data center that is protected by the virtual being within your physical reach, data centers hosting your cloud resources on an undisclosed data centers managed by AWS. By now, you'd probably surmised that's not the best idea to provide unrestricted access to your IT resources, to everyone in your organization. But is there an easy way to provide extremely granular access permissions to every user and service, but, at the same time, make them easy to manage? Thankfully, AWS has a service called Identity Access Management, commonly referred to as IAM, which helps you do just that. Identity and Access Management, or IAM , is a free service provided by AWS that enables you to manage access to services and resources on the AWS Cloud. You can create and manage users and groups as well as set permissions to allow or deny access to various resources. The permissions are global, which means that the access you set for a user or group will be true for all regions in AWS Cloud. When providing access to users and services, you should follow the principle of least privilege. There are a few ways you can set permissions for various services or users to access your AWS resources. You can use IAM to manage users, manage roles, and manage federated users. The first way you can set access is by using IAM to manage users. You can create users in IAM and assign them individual security credentials. These users can have very granular permission sets so you can control which operations a user can perform on which specific service. A user could be administrators that need console access to manage the AWS Cloud account, end users who need to access content in the AWS Cloud account, or systems that need the ability to programmatically access data in the AWS Cloud account. Programmatic access means that applications are directly accessing resources in the AWS Cloud as opposed to humans doing the same activity. Another way to set access is to manage IAM roles. You can create roles to manage permissions and control what these roles can do in your AWS instance. An entity assumes a role and can obtain a set of temporary security credentials to make API calls to your AWS resources. This could be used to provide access to a user from another AWS account to your AWS account, such as when an organization has separate development and production environments. The last way to set access is to manage federated users. By enabling identity federation, you can allow existing identities in your enterprise to access your AWS Cloud instance without having to create an IAM user for each user. You can use any identity management solution that supports SAML 2.0 or use one of AWS's federation samples. You've probably experienced identity federation in action when you sign up for an online service using your Facebook or Gmail account. In a corporate setting, you could have your Microsoft Active Directory users have federated access to your AWS Cloud instance using identity federation. Some benefits of IAM are enhanced security, granular control, ability to provide temporary credentials, flexible security credential management, ability to leverage external identity systems using federated access, and seamlessly integrating various AWS services within the AWS Cloud infrastructure.

## Principle of least privilege

- Principle of Least Privilege. Who can access what? When you start a new job, you get some accounts to log in. It could be your not-so-new computer with someone else's coffee stains on the keys or your corporate email account that has 50 emails waiting for you already. Or it could be your company shared network drive on the server where your team and your predecessors have been keeping documents that everyone needs to access. Say you work in a sales department, you should have access only to resources and information that you require to do your job. That could be the client list for your team or deck templates for slideshows you will now be creating to present to potential clients or even the products you're selling. However, you will not expect and should not have access to resources like pending legal cases being handled by the legal department. The not yet release product mockups being developed by your dev teams or list of personnel reshuffling that the HR department is contemplating. This concept of providing access only to resources that a person needs to do his job and no more is called the Principle of Least Privilege. The concept is this. The CEO of the company should have access to a lot of the corporate resources. The newly hired sales associate should not. The IT department should have ability to administer the services, but probably not have access to the sensitive information and files themselves. Every role has a set of access permissions necessary to effectively complete its job, and the individual in the role should have no more or no less than the optimal level of access. To follow the Principle of Least Privilege in AWS, you provide access to services and resources for your users and other AWS services by using a service called Identity Access Management or IAM. When you provide users or services access using IAM policies, you should start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions only as necessary, determine what the user or service needs to be able to do and craft policies to allow them to perform only those specific tasks. For example, a marketing manager might need to access a certain marketing related S3 bucket to upload flat files for the company's website. You may remember that S3 is a file storage service offered by AWS, and buckets are like folders inside the service that holds your files. However, he would not need access to the S3 buckets where error logs are being dumped into by an app being developed by the dev team, the IAM access granted to the marketing manager should provide him only the absolute necessary access in the company's AWS Cloud infrastructure. Remember, to provide only the minimum amount of access a personal service requires, and nothing more to keep your AWS Cloud infrastructure secured.

## Keeping accounts secured

- While most of us are familiar with the concept of passwords, there are many different ways to keep accounts in an IT system secured. If we take passwords, which is a type of security credentials, IT administrators can set password policies to require accounts to follow specific guidelines when setting up a password, like a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, a number, a symbol, can't have your name in the password, et cetera, et cetera. Then we'll also likely set a password policy for how long you can keep a password before you have to change it to keep your account secured. And some go as far as to requiring your new passwords to not be the same as your previous three or five passwords. Another type of security credentials are access keys. One would utilize access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS. Programmatic access refers to the ability to interact with AWS without using the AWS Management Console, and instead by utilizing a programmatic interface, which usually utilizes API, or application programming interface. In a very general sense, you can think of programmatic access as utilizing code to interact with AWS, making it do this or that. Access keys are like username and passwords for human accounts with an access key ID and a secret access key. The secret access key is usually only available to be downloaded when the key is created. AWS does not recommend long-term usage of access keys, and instead recommends utilizing temporary security credentials, which includes a security token that specifies when the credentials expire. A security feature that is gaining widespread adoption recently is multifactor authentication, or MFA. It's likely that at least a few online services you utilize on day-to-day have begun requiring MFA in order to keep your accounts secured. MFAs are also known as two-factor authentication, or 2FA. In order to log into these accounts, a user must present at least two pieces of evidence, called factors, that verify that they indeed should be accessing this said account. If you utilize online banking, you probably have MFA enabled on your account. You would put in your username and password and may be prompted to receive a phone call or text message with code to input or to authenticate using your authentication application like Google Authenticator or perhaps to authenticate by clicking Allow in your bank's mobile application. Your friend, Steve, who works in IT, probably tells you not to write your password on a sticky note and put it up on your computer monitor. That's sound advice, but with every service and account requiring a complicated password while requesting it you don't reuse passwords, it's really hard to keep track of them all. AWS Secrets Manager saves all of your secrets, like passwords, credentials, tokens, access keys, and other confidential information that requires keeping. Utilizing AWS Secrets Manager will allow you to, you guessed it, manage your secrets securely, even integrating with key AWS services to help manage your credentials and access.

## Security Services

## AWS Systems Manager

- AWS Systems manager is yet another centralized control tower to help you safely manage your AWS resources in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Instead of having to log into many different AWS systems individually, you can visualize and operate on multiple AWS services regardless of whether your infrastructure utilizes the cloud, multi-cloud, or hybrid environment, AWS Systems manager automates processes like patching and resource changes, helps identify issues quickly and even remediates those issues before they affect users and centralizes operational data so it's easier to review. You can create logical groups of resources and then select a resource group to view many metrics like recent API activity, configuration changes, notifications, operational alerts, patch compliance status, and more. Once you take a peek, you can take actions on the resource group right in the AWS System Manager as needs arise. This tool is for IT administrators who need a centralized view of the IT infrastructure to make sure it's running smoothly and to alert them when resources may not meet internal compliance policies.

## AWS WAF (web application firewall)

- Web application firewall or WAF. AWS web application firewall, commonly referred to as AWS WAF, protects web applications running on AWS Cloud from common web exploits. As the name suggests, it's a firewall service for your web applications. Fancy that. WAF can protect against exploits that could compromise security or availability of your web apps. It can also protect the application from exploits that could force your app to consume excessive resources, which in turn could end up costing you a lot of money. With WAF, you only pay for what you use with no upfront commitments. Web application firewall improves web traffic visibility, provides cost-effective web application protection, and delivers increased security and protection against web attacks. It is also easy to deploy and maintain as you can deploy it on Amazon CloudFront as part of your content delivery network solution or via Amazon API gateway. There is no additional software that you need to deploy, and you can reuse the centrally defined rules across all of your web applications. AWS WAF is an affordable, malleable, and adaptable protection for your web applications running on AWS Cloud that is easy to manage and deploy.

## AWS Shield

- AWS Shield. Have you ever experienced distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks? You might have tried to access your favorite social network platform, only to find that the website is glitchy or nothing is loading on your browser. You might Google the website or complain about it on another social media network, and you might find out that the website is experiencing a DDoS attack. A distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS attack, is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable temporarily or indefinitely, most often by making excessive repeated access requests to the website using thousands of unique IP addresses. Basically, a hacker or malicious personal organization would overload the server with access requests, so that real users can't access the website because it's too busy. Have you ever felt extremely overwhelmed by multiple requests coming from all different places? Maybe you worked at an extremely busy restaurant when a coworker called out. Or you had multiple project deadlines at the office while some dumpster fire was going on that you needed to fix. You likely felt overwhelmed, exhausted, and unsure how to deal with the workload, and perhaps you mentally shut down, unable to process all the different requests. This is what happens to the service when it's under a DDoS attack. AWS has a service called AWS Shield, which provides detection and automatic mitigations to minimize the effects of DDoS attack on your applications. AWS Shield helps to minimize application downtime and latency when an attack happens. There are two tiers to AWS Shield in terms of protection and cost. The Standard tier is automatically enabled, free to use, and protects your web application against majority of common DDoS attacks. When used with CloudFront and Route 53, you can obtain comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure attacks. The second tier is called Shield Advanced, and it provides 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS response team. It detects and mitigates sophisticated DDoS attacks with near real-time visibility into the events, and integrates with AWS WAF. Shield Advanced provides higher-level protections, network and transport layer protections, and automated application traffic monitoring. Shield Advanced also provides financial protection against DDoS-related spikes for charges for EC2, elastic load balancers, CloudFront, and Route 53. It is available globally on all CloudFront and Route 53 edge locations. This means that your web application can be hosted anywhere in the world, but still be protected by AWS Shield, as long as you are able to deploy CloudFront instance in front of the server. With two-tiered support, AWS Shield can provide comprehensive protection against DDoS attacks, small and large, that is catered to your budget and needs. If you have a small product, you can get started with the Standard protection. And as it scales, you can upgrade your protection to suit your needs.

## Amazon Inspector

- Amazon Inspector. If you or your company develops applications, there's a service that can provide your auditors and your development team a peace of mind, knowing that the applications adhere to security standards set by the company and the industry as a whole. Amazon Inspector's an automated security assessment service for your applications deployed on AWS. This means that it helps you improve the security and compliance of these applications by automatically assessing them for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. Once the assessment is completed, it generates detailed reports to help you check for unintended vulnerabilities. Security teams can then get reports validating that tests were performed. Inspector helps to reduce the risk of introducing security issues during deployment and development by proactively identifying potential issues that do not align with best practices and policies. You can define your own standards and best practices and make sure that they're being followed, or you can choose to utilize AWS's constantly updated standards. As the name suggests, Amazon Inspector inspects your applications to find security issues and bring them to your attention.

## AWS Trusted Advisor

- AWS Trusted Advisor. Have you ever looked at your finances and thought, "Well, dang, I wish someone would tell me "what to do with my money "so I could have a comfortable early retirement"? "I've tried some investments. "I've tried putting money into 401k, "but I have no idea if I'm doing any of this right." Oftentimes, the people you call up about your money health are called financial advisors. For your AWS Cloud infrastructure, you have Trusted Advisor. AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that guides the provisioning of your resources so that you are following AWS best practices. Upon scanning your AWS infrastructure, Trusted Advisor advises you on how your infrastructure is or is not following AWS best practices based on five categories. The categories are cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. AWS then provides action recommendations to bring your infrastructure closer to best practice standards. All AWS customers have access to seven core Trusted Advisor checks for free. These checks are S3 bucket permissions, security groups, specific ports unrestricted, IAM use, MFA on root account, EBS public snapshots, RDS public snapshots, and service limits. For those with enterprise or business support plans, there are extended set of checks and recommendations available. On top of more types of checks, those with full Trusted Advisor access also get notifications through weekly updates and ability to set up automated actions and response to alerts with Amazon CloudWatch. They also have programmatic access to the scan results via AWS Support API. AWS Trusted Advisor is a valuable ally in making sure that deployment of your AWS Cloud resources are aligned with best practices, as well as providing you customized recommendations based on proactive monitoring of your infrastructure.

## Amazon GuardDuty

- Amazon GuardDuty. In a perfect world, you wouldn't need to sleep so that you can be up at all times of the day and night monitoring your cloud infrastructure for threats and malicious activities. Unfortunately, we all need sleep, and some departments don't have the budget to have people staring at dashboards 24/7. Thankfully, you don't have to because AWS Cloud has a service that stays up all day and night for you. It's called Amazon GuardDuty, and it's a threat-detection service that monitors from malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS Cloud instance 24/7. It analyzes billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, which can then send actionable alerts via AWS CloudWatch events. GuardDuty uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats that may impact your AWS Cloud infrastructure. Best of all, you can deploy GuardDuty within a few clicks as there is no additional software or infrastructure to manage to take advantage of that protection. Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors your AWS Cloud infrastructure, intelligently detects threats using machine learning, and helps you take action immediately if a threat is found so that you and your team can have a good night's sleep, knowing your infrastructure is being monitored at all times.

## AWS Artifact

- It's Monday morning, your boss or your auditors or regulators suddenly swarm you asking to see security and compliance documents, or audit artifacts, that prove that your AWS infrastructure and services you're utilizing comply with security standards. Uh-oh, where do you go to quickly collect this information? Well, of course, AWS has a service to help you do just that, and it's free. AWS Artifact is an on-demand self-service portal that allows you to download AWS security and compliance documents and independent software vendor, or ISV, compliance reports. ISV compliance reports are for independent software vendors who sell their products on the AWS marketplace that you may purchase to utilize in your own infrastructure. Of course, as you learn from the shared responsibility model, just because the AWS services or the ISV provided products are compliant, doesn't mean your infrastructure is, depending on how you architected it or utilized the resources available. You as the customer are responsible for developing and obtaining documents that demonstrate your infrastructure security and compliance. AWS Artifact can also be utilized to review, accept, and track status of your AWS agreements depending on the industry of your organization. An example of an AWS agreement could be the Business Associate Addendum that is typically required for companies that work with protected health information, or PHI, and are thus subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, to safeguard patient information.

## Governance and compliance services

- There are some AWS services that help with governance and compliance in the AWS infrastructure. While we won't go too deep into the nitty gritty of what these services are and what they do, we want to make sure we go over them on a mile high level so you can recognize them if they come up in the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Some of these services are Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Audit Manager, and AWS Config. First up is Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon CloudWatch observes and monitors application performance. You can set alarms and automated actions to activate at predetermined thresholds to automatically mitigate potential issues. Next is AWS CloudTrail. It generates audit trails of every action taken by a user role or an AWS service in your account, so when an event occurs, you'll know exactly what user did, what, and when. As the name suggests, AWS Audit Manager automates evidence collection to generate audit ready reports to prove system compliance with audits. Finally, AWS Config provides detailed view of AWS resource configurations in your AWS account, as well as tracks how configurations and relationships between resources change over time. It can even monitor configuration settings and send alerts when a resource violates your rules to help keep your infrastructure compliant.

## Study break: Reviewing security services

- We went over quite a few security services in this section. Let's quickly review them to refresh your minds. AWS Assistance Manager is an IT administration service that allows you to safely manage your AWS resources in the cloud, multi-cloud, or hybrid environments from one central service, automating processes like patching and resource changes, identifying issues quickly, and sometimes even remediating these issues before they affect users, and centralizing operational data for easier review. AWS web application firewall or AWS WAF is, as the name suggests, a firewall service for web applications running on AWS. It protects web applications from common web exploits, provides web traffic visibility and delivers increased security against web attacks. AWS Shield protects your web applications from distributed denial of service or DDOS attacks by providing detection and automatic mitigations of DDOS attacks, helping to minimize the damage to your system and wallet. Amazon Inspector inspects your AWS applications automatically assessing them for exposure, vulnerabilities, and derivations from best practices. After the assessment is completed, it generates a detailed report for you to review, helping you reduce risks of introducing security issues. You can even define your own standards to check against an Amazon inspector's reports will help validate that specific tests were performed. AWS trusted advisor advises you on whether or not your AWS infrastructure is following AWS best practices based on five categories, optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. It provides recommendations on how you can bring your infrastructure closer to meet standards. Amazon Guard duty monitors all your infrastructure 24/7 for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior utilizing machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence. AWS artifact is an on-demand self-service portal that allows you to download AWS security and compliance documents, as well as independent software vendor or ISV compliance reports. It allows you to review, accept, and track status of AWS agreements that align with your organization's industry. We learned about a few governance and compliance services available from AWS. They were Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Audit Manager, and AWS Config. Amazon CloudWatch observes and monitors application performance and allows you to set alarms and automated actions triggered by certain events. AWS Cloud Trail generates audit trails of every action taken by a user role on an AWS service in your AWS account. AWS Audit Manager automates evidence collection to generate audit ready reports, and AWS config provides detailed views of AWS resource configurations, as well as tracks configuration and relationship changes for your AWS resources. Wow, that was a lot. If you feel like you need to review any of these services, please feel free to go back to the videos in this section. See you in the next section.

## Conclusion

## Study break: Exam review

- Oh boy, that was quite a bit of information. Let's quickly review what we've learned in this course so you're set up for success with preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. This course went over the Security and Compliance domain of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam, which now makes up 30% of the exam content. The percentage of the exam dedicated to security topics has been going up steadily over the years, which seems to follow the trend of companies and society placing more and more emphasis on cloud security and data privacy. The Security and Compliance domain is concerned with how to make sure your IT infrastructure hosted on AWS cloud is safe from both internal and external security threats. There are four task statements in a Security and Compliance domain which are: understand the AWS shared responsibility model; understand AWS cloud security, governance, and compliance concepts; identify AWS access management capabilities; and identify components and resources for security. Some core concepts we went over are the shared responsibility model, principle of least privilege, the security pillar of the Well-Architected Framework, and access management in AWS. In the shared responsibility model, the most important concept to understand is that you as the customer and AWS as the cloud computing service provider share the responsibilities of keeping AWS cloud secure. Customers are responsible for security in the cloud, and AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. How do you make sure that you're keeping the information in the cloud secure? You should only provide the least amount of access possible for any entity to make sure that no one has access to resources they're not entitled to. This concept is called the principle of least privilege. The security pillar of the Well-Architected Framework states that the security of the cloud is composed of Identity and Access Management, detective controls, infrastructure protection, data protection, and incident response. Access management in AWS went through concepts like IAM roles, permissions, and policies, how to keep accounts secured, and the importance of the AWS account root user. We went over a lot of security services such as the AWS Identity and Access Management, IAM Identity Center, AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager, AWS Web Application Firewall, AWS Shield, Amazon Inspector, AWS Trusted Advisor, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Artifact, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Audit Manager, AWS Config. There are definitely quite a few of them, so please feel free to go back and watch the corresponding videos again if you feel the need to do a quick refresher. If you're in a time crunch, the previous section is a quick overview in one slide for all the services we learned about in this course. The exam may ask where you can locate AWS security information or if third-party security products are available. You can find AWS security information in the AWS Knowledge Center, AWS Security Center, and the AWS Security Blog. There are also third-party security products available from the AWS Marketplace to help keep your infrastructure secured. Thank you so much for following along in our journey to learn about Security and Compliance in the AWS Cloud. I hope you learned a lot and I'm looking forward to seeing you again in the other courses in this series.
