### Introduction

Slither into advanced core Python code challenges
- Welcome to Level Up, Advanced Python Code Challenges. You're probably wondering how do you even define what makes the cut for something to be considered advanced Python? I've decided to go with Python topics that I would consider an intermediate or advanced user should know. topics that are reasonably popular, and well used in code, and then developed a reasonable use case or challenge for them. This means the problems will include a mix of decorators, nametuples, the collections and itertool modules, error and data handling, and context managers amongst others. Hi, I'm Jonathan Fernandes. I work in machine learning and AI, and use Python every day. Each video in this course is self-contained, and has an explanation of the code challenge, along with my solution. Now I've limited myself to just the standard Python library, but you can use other modules if you think it'll help. Most solutions are from one to two lines, to a couple of lines. I've also included test files, so you can produce any solution you like as long as it passes the test. I hope you enjoy these code challenges. Let's get started. (electronic chime)

Using GitHub Codespaces with this course
- This is Ray Villalobos, senior staff instructor at LinkedIn Learning, and I'm going to show you how to work with LinkedIn Learning courses using GitHub Codespaces. Codespaces is a code editor in the cloud with the full power of Visual Studio Code. It allows for real world hands on practice that mirrors software development in the workplace. This course was created using GitHub Codespaces. Using Codespaces, you have everything you need to get going without needing complex installations or build tools. One click and you're ready to go. To practice along with the course, you can create a codespace directly from the course overview page. First, click open next to GitHub Codespaces. If you're already logged in, you'll be directed to a getting started with GitHub Codespaces page. If you're not logged in, you'll be prompted to log in or create a free GitHub account first. From this page, click on create codespace on main. The first time you open up a codespace, it might take a few minutes to create the virtual machine. Once it's done, you'll enter the code editor environment. If you're familiar with Visual Studio Code, this is a special version of that editor running on GitHub's servers. Your course can have one or more extensions pre-installed based on the course you're taking. Those can be found in the extensions panel. Because this is a browser, it's easy to inadvertently close the browser window and lose the editor. If you do that, don't panic. Codespaces saves everything you're doing on a virtual machine. You can always get the codespace back for this repo right here. Notice that it even remembered that I had opened the extensions panel. An alternate way to create a codespace is directly from one of our course's GitHub repositories. From here, click code and then create codespace on main. You can also restart a previous codespace from this location. GitHub Codespaces is compatible on devices with smaller screen sizes like mobile phones or tablets, but it is optimized for larger screens so we recommend that you practice along with this course on a laptop or desktop computer. The sample course I'm looking at is what is known as a flat branch repository. You can tell because there's a single branch when you click on the branch icon on the status bar. You can also tell because there are different folders for each of the videos in the course. This is a sample of what a multi branch repository looks like which is more common when you're working with web frameworks. If you go to the branch icon on the status bar, you can see that there's more than one branch. You can switch to the different branches using this menu. The branches are named with the chapter and the video number you're watching. If you see a B at the end of the branch, that's how the code looked at the beginning. If you see an E, that's how the code looked at the end. Let's switch to how the code looked on chapter two and the third video. I'll choose the beginning branch. As you work through a course, you might make some changes on a branch. I'm going to make a minor edit on the index.html file right here. I'm going to go ahead and save that, and you can see that I've modified this file because there's an M right here and the branch name now has an asterisk on it. If I try to switch to another branch that causes major changes like say, 07_03e, I may see a dialogue box like this. If you don't care about saving your changes, you can simply hit the force checkout button. It will let you switch to that branch. You can then choose to discard the changes on this file. Your instructor will let you know what the folder structure is for your course. Forking lets you create your own copy of the repository on your account so that you can keep any changes that you've made, even if you've deleted the codespace. To create your own fork, you can click on the fork button on the repository. I'm going to hit create fork. I'll have my own copy of this repository, and if I want to, I can start a new codespace on that fork. This forked version is almost exactly like the original repository but it will let you push your own changes. Notice that the URL of the repository is slightly different. Let's go ahead and make a simple change to this file right here. I'm going to save it. You'll note that there is an M right here as well as an asterisk on this branch. In the source control panel, you can also see a one for the change that we just made. Let's go ahead and try to commit this change. I'm going to hit the commit button and I'll ask it to go ahead and stage the changes. And then I'm going to hit this button here. I'll hit okay. You can also let it go ahead and run git fetch. That way, it'll automatically sync with your forked repo. Now that change will be stored in your own version of this repository. Don't worry if you forget to fork a repo and then try to push changes. Codespaces will also ask you if you want to create a fork automatically. Look for additional course specific tips from the instructor. Now, let's get back to the course.

### Code Challenges

Find a runner’s average race time
- We're going to start off with a simple challenge to get you warmed up. In this challenge, given a log of race times we're going to determine the average race time for Jennifer Rhines, who's an American long distance runner. We're using a data set that has race times for women 10K runners from the Association of Road Racing Statisticians. So in this challenge we're going to update average race time dot py. So complete the get rhines times function which returns a list of Jennifer Rhines race times and then complete the get average function which returns Jennifer Rhines average race time and see the function docstrings for details of the format of the return values. You can use the test file in the test directory, so this is a sub directory of challenge to check your solution if you want or you can completely ignore it. We'll use the pytest framework to test your code. Now, if you're using code spaces you don't need to take any action. This package has been installed already. If you're working in a different I.D you'll need to have this package installed. Just do pip install pytest. Let me give you an example of this. I'm currently in the challenge directory, I go ahead and type pytest and then the part to the files. That's tests, test average race time. Now you can see that I get the message to field and that's because I haven't created any code yet in the average race time dot pyfile. So once you've created your solution re-run the pytest command, and if you get the message in green showing that all of the tests have past, then you're done. So go ahead to the average race time dot pyfile and use this as your starting point. Re-read the docstrings for each of the functions and look at the test files to check that you have the output in the expected format. So pause the video here and I'll show you the solution I came up with. Let's head over to the get rhines times function. We first create a list rhines times that we will populate with her race times. We then work our way through each line of the 10K race times. If the line includes the string, Jennifer Rhines, we then want to hand that off to the get time function. The get time function uses a regular expression to capture her times. And we then add each of the times to the list rhines times. And finally, we return this list at the end of the function. In the function get average, we use the results of the function that we created earlier. We call get rhines times. This returns a list of Jennifer Rhines race times and we store this in race times. We then want to sum all of her race times and store it in the variable total. All of her race times are in minutes and seconds but some of them include a millisecond component so we use a try and accept to deal with that. We then return the total divided by the number of entries in the list. And because of the formatting requirements from the docstring, we don't include the hour but we will also include the first millisecond digit. So let's check this, pass all the tests. So let me give myself a little bit of space. I'm just going to clear my screen. So pytest, test, and test. Average race time and this green bar confirms that we've passed all the tests. Now, my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead and share your solution in the Q&A section. Now, just so you know, if you just post your code in the Q&A section as plain text, it won't be formatted, and so it'll be difficult to read. You might want to post the link to your code snippet using something like github gist instead. I'd love to see your answer to this code challenge.

HTML to markdown converter
- In this challenge, we're going to convert text from HTML to Markdown. We're going to implement a small portion of the html2markdown Python package. So let's go ahead and update html2markdown.py. So you want to convert to italics, so that's HTML em tags to asterisks. We want to convert consecutive spaces or line breaks to a single space. We want to convert to paragraphs, so that's HTML p tags to two line breaks. And finally, we want to convert URLs from HTML links to Markdown. You can also test your file using pytest and the test_html2markdown file in the test directory. Let me give you a couple of examples of what HTML to Markdown looks like. So if I use em tags for italics, I get this as the output, and if I have consecutive spaces, this is what your code should return. And finally, when using paragraphs, this is the output you should get. So go ahead and use the html2markdown as your starting point. Pause the video here and I'll show you the solution I came up with. (energetic music) Now, one way to think of this is as a pipeline of processing operations to be performed on your HTML text. I've decided to go with regular expression values and using the re.compile objects. For italics, we're using capturing groups to pick up anything with em tags and then inserting an asterisk on either side. Regular expressions are greedy by default, so if there were multiple em tags, it would pick up the text between the first opening em tag and the last closing em tag, including any opening and closing em tags in between. We don't want this, and so adding a question mark makes the regular expression non-greedy and picks up each of the item tags separately. For spaces, we are taking one or more white spaces and replacing them with a single space. And when we deal with paragraphs, we do so in a similar way to italics. For the URLs, we need two caption groups, and this is to capture the URL and the link. And finally, for the URLs, we need two caption groups, the URL and the link, and we use a backslash one and a backslash two to capture the URL and the link. And finally, we remove any leading or trailing white space and return the text. Let's check this passes all our tests. So let me make a little bit of room, so clear, pytest, test and the path to the test file, and you can see that we've got a green bar that suggests that we've passed all of the tests. Now, my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead and share your solution in the Q&A section. Now, just so you know, if you just post your code in the Q&A section as plain text, it won't be formatted, and so it'll be difficult to read. You might want to post the link to your code snippet using something like GitHub's Gist instead. I'd love to see your answer to this code challenge.

Create a pairwise offset
- In this challenge we're going to create a pair-wise offset function that takes in as input a sequence amongst other things. Now a sequence is anything that you can index, slice and determine its length. So examples of sequences are strings, topples, and lists. And I want you to accept any sequence as an argument into the pair-wise offset function. Now this visualization will help you understand how the pair-wise offset function should work. So imagine you made a copy of this sequence, so that one is below the other. You should return an iterable that includes a topple of each corresponding item. Now you should also accept an offset, and the offset will always be greater than or equal to zero. So let's look at an example where the offset is one. Then the second sequence is moved across by one. This also means we need some sort of a fill value, and we use asterisks or stars here as an example. Now because the first topple will have the first value from the sequence and because we have an offset of one. There is no component from the second sequence, but just the fill value. And as we have an offset of one we want to use the same fill value when we have run out of items for the first sequence. Let me show you the same example in code. So we enter the list A, B, C with an offset of one to the pair-wise offset function. And we get the expected list of topples. And just to recap, update the file pairwise_offset.py so that it accepts a sequence. It accepts an offset using zero if nothing is provided. It accepts a fill value using a star or asterisk if nothing is provided. It returns an iterable that includes a topple of each corresponding item. And you can test your solution using pytest. So go ahead and use the pairwise_offset.py as your starting point. So go ahead and use the pairwise_offset.py as your starting point. Pause the video here and I'll show you the solution I came up with. Let's give ourselves a little bit of space. So I'm just going to exit out of here. We can use T from the edit tools module to return a topple of two independent iterators. This is like making the copy of the sequence that we saw in the visualization. We can then use the chain class from the itertools module to combine iterables. In this case we want an offset number of fill values at the front of IT2. We then use zip_longest to combine IT1 and this newly formed iterable. This means that when we have run out of iterables from IT1, we can have fill values substituted in their place. So let's check this passes all the tests. So I'm just going to clear my screen and pytest. Tests and test pairwise_offset.py And from the output in green you can see that this has passed all the tests. Now my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead and share your solution in the Q&A section. I'm really keen to see how you solved this code challenge.

Find a runner’s age at slowest race time
- In this challenge, we're going to determine the age of an athlete and the time she took when running her slowest 10K race. (computer blipping) We're going to use the data set with race times for women 10K runners from the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, and we'll focus on American long distance runner, Jennifer Rhines. In this challenge, we're going to update age slowest race dot py. So go ahead and complete the get event time function which returns a tuple of Jennifer Rhines' age at a race and her race time. And then complete get age slowest times function which returns a tuple of Jennifer Rhines age and her slowest race time. Check out the function docstrings for details of the format of the return values and then you can use pytest to test your code. So go ahead and use age slowest race dot py as your starting point. Remember to look at the docstring and the test to check that you have the right format. Pause the video here and I'll show you the solution I came up with. (quirky electronic blipping) So let's head over to the get age slowest times function. So we work our way through each line of the 10K race times. If the line contains the string, Jennifer Rhines, we want to pass it off to the get event time function. So if we move up to the get event time function, the first thing we want to do is to take the line that contains Jennifer Rhines and we want to be able to get the race times. And we're able to get the race times because we use the regular expression module and the find all function. The get race times function will extract and return only Jennifer's race times. Next, we need to determine the age of the athlete at each of the events. Now if you look at the 10K Race Times file, you can see that for each race, we have the race event date and the date of birth of the athlete. So if we head back to our code, we want to collect both of these dates and we pass this to the get age function that will determine the athlete's age for that race. And this is the get age function. We then want to return the athlete's age and the time for a race as a tuple. And this is stored in the race age list, which we've defined earlier. So race age is a list of age and race times tuples and we want to pass this to the max built-in function. And this will allow us to capture the slowest race. Now because we need the age in a certain format, we pass the age to the format date function so that we can get an age back in the format described in the docstrings. So A, number of years and B, number of days. And we then return this and the slowest race times and we're done. So let's check this passes all the tests. So pytest, tests and test age slowest race dot py and you can see that it's past all the tests. And so we're done. Now my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead and share your solution in the Q and A section. Now, just so you know, if you just post your code in the Q and A section as plain text, it won't be formatted, and so it'll be difficult to read. You might want to post the link to your code snippet using something like GitHub's Gist instead. I'd love to see your answer to this code challenge.

Context managers: Calculator
- In this challenge, we're going to create a context manager called calculator. (screen tinkling) Now, before we get started, let's take a quick refresher of just three examples of errors available in Python. Now, there are loads more, but we'll focus on these for now. You've probably come across the type error. So if I try and add the integer 2 to the string 2, I get a type error. As I'm trying to add an integer and a string together. And I can fix this by passing the string 2 to the integer function. And so this is going to give me a result of 2, and then I can add that back to the value of 2 to get a total value of 4. If I try and pass the string A to an integer function, I get a value error because that's an incorrect data type. I need to have an integer or a string value that is numeric as the argument. And finally, if I try and divide a number by zero, I get a zero division error. So we'll stick to these three errors for now. Now as a quick refresher, a context manager is an object that can be used with a with block. So you've probably seen this used to automatically close files when you're done working with it. And context managers need a dunder enter method and a dunder exit method. And the dunder exit method accepts three positional arguments. The exception class or type, the exception object value, and a trace back object for the exception. Now in this challenge, you should be able to complete mathematical calculations in your calculator context manager, as long as there's none of these three errors. And as soon as there's an error, you need to gracefully stop without raising any exceptions. You should also be able to determine what error caused the calculator to stop working. So let me give you an example of how the calculator context manager needs to work. The calculator context manager completes the first calculation, printing a result of two, it then prints out seven for the second calculation. So that's three plus four. But because the third calculation results in the type error, it stops and it doesn't raise any exceptions. Now, if I want to determine what's causing the calculator to stop, I can do that by typing a c.error. And you can see that we've got a type error here. Now you can also test your solution using the test file. Now, head back to calculator.py, and go ahead and update it and pause the video here and I'll show you the solution I came up with. (graphics warbling) (upbeat music) So we've got a class here called class calculator with our dunder init method, our dunder enter method, and our dunder exit method. In the dunder init method, we're passing across all of the exception types. So we just use *exc_types, to accept any number of arguments. Now when you enter the calculator block, the dunder enter method gets called. We often think of the dunder enter as the time to acquire resources or to do some setup work. So we want our context manager calculator to keep track of the state, and so the dunder enter method returns self, which passes the calculator object to the variable c. And by default, the dunder exit method has passed three arguments, the class or the type of the exception, the value of the exception, and the trace back of the exception. Now, if there are no exceptions, then these just have the value none. And if an exception has been raised, then these arguments have details about the exception. Now this is important. If the dunder exit returns something that's true, the exception raised in our context calculator block will be suppressed, and that's what we want. But if something that is false is returned, the exception will go up these stack traces. We assign self.error to the value of the exception. And since the second argument of this instance accepts a class or a topple, we can pass the exception types, which is one or more of the value error, the type error or the zero division error, which are all stored in a topple here. And we can then just return the instance here, which will return true or false. So let's check this passes all our tests. And you can see that this has passed all of the four tests that we have. Now, my solution is just one way of solving this problem. You could also use context managers from the contextlib module to solve this. So go ahead and share your solution in the Q&A section. I'm really keen to see how you solve this code challenge.

Get Olympic medals
- In this challenge, we're going to retrieve medal results from the Olympic Games. I really like the Olympic Games, and the Chariots of Fire is one of my favorite Olympic-related movies. In the 1924 Olympic Games, Eric Liddell, because of his religious convictions, ends up running the 400 meters, instead of his preferred hundred meter sprint. Now, I've read in data from the Olympics dataset, which includes medals won from 1896 to 2008, and it's stored in the variables "olympics," and each line in the dataset corresponds to a medal winner. In this challenge, create "medals," which is a list of medal nametuples. Then go ahead, and complete the function "get_medals", so that anyone using it can enter one or more keyword arguments, and a list of medal nametuples is returned. So, let me give you an example. Now, we know that Eric Liddell competed in the 1924 Olympic Games, and participated in the 400 meter event. So how can we check if he competed in any other event in the 1924 Paris Games? Well, all I need to do is to remove the "Event" keyword argument. And you can see, that Eric Henry Liddell also took part in the 200 meter event, and received a bronze medal. Now, did he compete in any other Olympic games? While we know from the film, that this was his only Olympic games, and he later went to China as a missionary. So, let's go ahead and confirm that. So, I'm just going to clear my screen. And all I need to do, is to get rid of the "Edition". Now our function confirms and only returns details for the 1924 Olympics. Now, I should be able to enter the details into the "get_medals" function for any Olympic athlete, and for any of the games or events between 1896 and 2008. So go ahead and update "medals.py", and pause the video here, and I'll show you the solution I came up with. (8-bit music) Let's look at the "medals" list first. We go through each of the lines, skipping the first line, as this has the column headings. We then split each line by semicolons. This gives us a list, which we can then unpack into the "medal" namedtuples. Now, let's head over to the "get_medals" function. We accept, as input, the keyword arguments, and we then work our way through all of the medals in the list "medals," that we created a minute ago. And then we only want to return "medals", where the named attribute for "medal", so, that's the key in the keyword argument, is equal to the value. And we can use the "getattr," because we don't know in advance which attribute will be passed in. So let's go ahead and check, if this passes all our tests. "Pytest", test, "test_medal". And this message confirms, this passes all our tests. Now, my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead, and share your solution in the Q and A section. I'm really keen to see how you solved this code challenge.

Create an argument checker
- In this challenge, we're going to create an argument checker or arg checker decorator. Now, in Python, version 3.6 type hints were introduced. This allows you to specify what type an argument is. So is it an integer, a float, a boolean, and so on. Let me give you an example. So let's say we had a function called multiplier that has four arguments and returns the product of them. So multiplier 1, 2, 3, and 4 and I get the product of them as expected a value of 24. Now, if I entered three arguments instead of four I should raise a type error stating function multiplier takes four positional arguments, but three were given. Now let me just go ahead and clear my screen. Now, if I change one of the arguments to a type float, I should raise another type error saying the function multiplier expected positional arguments of type class int but got class float instead. And like all good decorator functions it should maintain the name and the doc string of the function that it decorates. This means that I can get the function name for multiplier. Let me go ahead and clear my screen. This means that I can get the function name for multiplier so, multiplier.name will give me the name and multiplier.done.doc will give me the doc string for the multiplier. And as you can see, the doc string for multipliers return the product of the argument. So here's the challenge. Create a decorator using the arg checker dot pie file that checks the number of arguments in a function and raises a type error. When there's a mismatch, it maintains the name and the doc stringing of the function that it decorates. You can test your solution using pytest. So go ahead and pause the video here and I'll show you the solution that I came up with. (upbeat music) We'll start off by importing wraps from funk tools. I'll talk more about this when we use it later in the code. We want our arg checker function to accept all of the positional arguments that are stored in arg types. We then go ahead and create a decorator function and then to ensure that we can preserve the name and the dot stringing of the function that we decorate. We use wrap from the funk tools module. In the wrap function, we want to make sure that the number of arguments in our decorator matches the number of arguments in the function that is decorated. If they don't match, you want to raise a type error and we can get the name of the decorated function by using func dot dnda name. The next check we want to do is to ensure that each of the positional arguments and the decorator is of the same type as in the function. We do this by zipping the decorator arguments and the function arguments together and then checking them one at a time. If the function argument isn't of the same type the decorator at that position, we raise another type error. And finally, we return each of the inner functions and we're done. So let's go ahead and check this passes all of our tests, so pytest, tests and test arg checker. And from the output here we can see that it's passed all the tests. Now my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead and share your solution in the Q and A section. Now, just so you know, if you just post your code in the Q and A section as plain text, it won't be formatted and so it'll be difficult to read. You might want to post the link to your code snippet using something like GitHub's "gist" instead. I'd love to see your answer to this code challenge.

Implement a LinkedIn checker
- In this challenge, we're going to create a LinkedIn checker for two LinkedIn features, creating a custom URL, and logging in. So let's look at each of these in turn. (bright beeping) LinkedIn allows you to create a custom URL for your profile. Now this is my LinkedIn profile, and you can see that in the custom URL section, it states that it must contain between 3 and 100 letters or numbers, and we can't use spaces, symbols, or special characters. When logging in, LinkedIn allows you to log in using either your email address or your phone number. For this challenge, we will check only for an email address, and not a phone number. Now even then, checking if a string is an email address is incredibly complicated, so we'll simplify things. We'll say that it only needs to have a set of characters before and after the at symbol, followed by the dot, and then the domain name can only be com, .org, or .net. We won't do checks for things like does the email address contain consecutive dots, or does it start with a non-alphanumeric character? We're going to create a LinkedIn checker that checks if the features conform to the conditions. So that's the custom URL, or logging in. Now, the requirements for each of these features is defined in specifications.txt, which is available in your exercise folder. So let's take a quick look at it. You can see that we have different requirements and permitted characters for the custom URL feature and the login feature. In the linkedin_checker.py file, you need to take these specifications and pass them into a dictionary of specs namedtuples. Specs, of course, being short for specifications. Now these specs namedtuples includes two components, range and regex. Range is to help with verifying that the length of the features meet the requirements. So for the custom URL as an example, that's between 3 and 100 characters. And regex is a re.compile object from the regular expression module, that helps you confirm the features contains only permitted characters. Again, using custom URL as an example, this can only be lower and uppercase alphabetical characters, and the digits zero to nine. So here's the challenge. Pass the specifications into a dictionary of specs namedtuples. Update the function check_linkedin_feature. This takes in as input the feature text and the URL or login, which is whether the feature text is a custom URL login. Now, if the feature text is valid, then return true, or else return false. And if the URL or login input isn't a custom URL or a login, then raise a ValueError. You can test your solution using pie test. So go ahead and pause the video here, and I'll show you the solution that I came up with. As always, you're welcome to come up with your own solution as long as it passes all the tests. (video game chimes and beeps) Let's head over to the get_linkedin_dict function. We need to convert the specification into a dict with keys being the feature, and the values of the dictionary being the specs namedtuple. So I initialize the dictionary that I'm going to use, and call it data. Next, we need to work our way through each line of specifications to determine the requirements and the permitted characters. If the line is in blank and contains the requirements, we want to pass the line and capture the minimum and maximum number of characters. If the line instead contains the string permitted characters, we need to gather them up, and put them into square brackets so that it can be used by the irregular expression compile object. This checks to see that each of the characters in any feature text only contains the accepted values for that feature. If the line from the specification contains the string login characters instead, then like before, we want to gather them up. Now, because a dot and a dash have a special meaning inside of square brackets of a regular expression, we would normally prepend them with a backslash. If we look at the specifications.txt file, for the line with login characters we have a couple of dashes for the login characters, A to Z, capital A to capital Z, and then finally, the dash by itself. Now, we only want to prepend a back slash for the dash by itself, and leave the other ones alone. So let's head back to the solution file. Now, one way we could do this is to use the replace function, but by default, it would replace all occurrences. Replace has an optional count positional argument that we would probably want to use, but it replaces one, two, or three occurrences, and so on, starting from the left to the right. Now, we only want to replace the last occurrence of the dash. One workaround is to reverse the string and then use replace with the positional count argument of one to replace the dash we want. But because we're going to reverse the string again to get our original regex, we need to add the back slash after the dot and the dash. This means that when the string is reversed, they prepend the dash. And finally, we reverse our regex back to its original form. We're now in a position to create our regular expression compile object, and as I said, the rules for an email address would be simplified, so we allow a set of one or more characters the at symbol, followed by the host name, which is a set of regex characters we've determined, followed by a dot, and then finally followed by the domain name. Let's go ahead and confirm this passes all our tests. Pytest test, and test linkedin_checker.py. And as you can see, it's passed all our tests, so we've completed the final challenge. Now my solution is just one way of solving this problem. Go ahead and share your solution in the Q and A section. Now, just so you know, if you just post your code in the Q and A section as plain text, it won't be formatted, and so it'll be difficult to read. You might want to post the link to your code snippet using something like GitHub's gist instead. I'd love to see your answer to this code challenge.
