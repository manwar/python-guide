### Introduction

Slither into advanced core Python code challenges
- Welcome to Level Up, Advanced Python Code Challenges. You're probably wondering how do you even define what makes the cut for something to be considered advanced Python? I've decided to go with Python topics that I would consider an intermediate or advanced user should know. topics that are reasonably popular, and well used in code, and then developed a reasonable use case or challenge for them. This means the problems will include a mix of decorators, nametuples, the collections and itertool modules, error and data handling, and context managers amongst others. Hi, I'm Jonathan Fernandes. I work in machine learning and AI, and use Python every day. Each video in this course is self-contained, and has an explanation of the code challenge, along with my solution. Now I've limited myself to just the standard Python library, but you can use other modules if you think it'll help. Most solutions are from one to two lines, to a couple of lines. I've also included test files, so you can produce any solution you like as long as it passes the test. I hope you enjoy these code challenges. Let's get started. (electronic chime)
